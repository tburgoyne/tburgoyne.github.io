	<b>Abstract</b>: Ultrastructural studies of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells are crucial to better understand the mechanisms of viral entry and budding within host cells. Here, we examined human airway epithelium infected with three different isolates of SARS-CoV-2 including the B.1.1.7 variant by transmission electron microscopy and tomography. For all isolates, the virus infected ciliated but not goblet epithelial cells. Key SARS-CoV-2 entry molecules, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, were found to be localised to the plasma membrane including microvilli but excluded from cilia. Consistently, extracellular virions were seen associated with microvilli and the apical plasma membrane but rarely with ciliary membranes. Profiles indicative of viral fusion where tomography showed that the viral membrane was continuous with the apical plasma membrane and the nucleocapsids diluted, compared with unfused virus, demonstrate that the plasma membrane is one site of entry where direct fusion releasing the nucleoprotein-encapsidated genome occurs. Intact intracellular virions were found within ciliated cells in compartments with a single membrane bearing S glycoprotein. Tomography showed concentration of nucleocapsids round the periphery of profiles strongly suggestive of viral budding into these compartments and this may explain how virions gain their S glycoprotein containing envelope. © 2022, The Author(s).

	<b>Abstract</b>: PURPOSE. To test the hypothesis that changing energy needs alter mitochondria distribution within the rod inner segment ellipsoid. METHODS. In mice with relatively smaller (C57BL/6J [B6J]) or greater (129S6/ev [S6]) retina mitochondria maximum reserve capacity, the profile shape of the rod inner segment ellipsoid zone (ISez) was measured with optical coherence tomography (OCT) under higher (dark) or lower (light) energy demand conditions. ISez profile shape was characterized using an unbiased ellipse descriptor (minor/major aspect ratio). Other bioenergy indexes evaluated include the external limiting membrane–retinal pigment epithelium (ELM-RPE) thickness and the magnitude of the signal intensity of a hyporeflective band located between the photoreceptor tips and apical RPE. The spatial distribution of rod ellipsoid mitochondria were also examined with electron microscopy. RESULTS. In B6J mice, darkness produced a greater ISez aspect ratio, thinner ELM-RPE, and a smaller hyporeflective band intensity than in light. In S6 mice, dark and light ISez aspect ratio values were not different and were greater than in light-adapted B6J mice; dark-adapted S6 mice showed smaller ELM-RPE thinning versus light, and negligible hyporeflective band intensity in the light. In B6J mice, mitochondria number in light increased in the distal inner segment ellipsoid and decreased proximally. In S6 mice, mitochondria number in the inner segment ellipsoid were not different between light and dark, and were greater than in B6J mice. CONCLUSIONS. These data raise the possibility that rod mitochondria activity in mice can be noninvasively evaluated based on the ISez profile shape, a new OCT index that complements OCT energy biomarkers measured outside of the ISez region. © 2022 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc..

	<b>Abstract</b>: Impaired pancreatic β-cell function and insulin secretion are hallmarks of type 2 diabetes. miRNAs are short, noncoding RNAs that silence gene expression vital for the development and function of β cells. We have previously shown that β cell-specific deletion of the important energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) results in increased miR-125b-5p levels. Nevertheless, the function of this miRNA in β cells is unclear. We hypothesized that miR-125b-5p expression is regulated by glucose and that this miRNA mediates some of the deleterious effects of hyperglycemia in β cells. Here, we show that islet miR-125b-5p expression is upregulated by glucose in an AMPK-dependent manner and that short-term miR-125b-5p overexpression impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in the mouse insulinoma MIN6 cells and in human islets. An unbiased, high-throughput screen in MIN6 cells identified multiple miR-125b-5p targets, including the transporter of lysosomal hydrolases M6pr and the mitochondrial fission regulator Mtfp1. Inactivation of miR-125b-5p in the human β-cell line EndoCβ-H1 shortened mitochondria and enhanced GSIS, whereas mice overexpressing miR-125b-5p selectively in β cells (MIR125B-Tg) were hyperglycemic and glucose intolerant. MIR125B-Tg β cells contained enlarged lysosomal structures and had reduced insulin content and secretion. Collectively, we identify miR-125b as a glucose-controlled regulator of organelle dynamics that modulates insulin secretion. © 2022 by the American Diabetes Association.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a major threat to domestic and wild European rabbits. Presently, in Europe, the disease is caused mainly by Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2/b or Lagovirus europaeus GI.2), the origin of which is still unclear, as no RHDV2 reservoir hosts were identified. After the RHDV2 emergence in 2010, viral RNA was detected in a few rodent species. Furthermore, RHDV2 was found to cause disease in some hare species resembling the disease in rabbits, evidencing the ability of the virus to cross the species barrier. In this study, through molecular, histopathologic, antigenic and morphological evidences, we demonstrate the presence and replication of RHDV2 in Eurasian badgers (Meles meles) found dead in the district of Santarém, Portugal, between March 2017 and January 2020. In these animals, we further classify the RHDV2 as a Lagovirus europaeus recombinant GI.4P-GI.2. Our results indicate that Meles meles is susceptible to RHDV2, developing systemic infection, and excreting the virus in the faeces. Given the high viral loads seen in several organs and matrices, we believe that transmission to the wild rabbit is likely. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy data show the presence of calicivirus compatible virions in the nucleus of hepatocytes, which constitutes a paradigm shift for caliciviruses’ replication cycle. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Zebrafish is a vertebrate teleost widely used in many areas of research. As embryos, they develop quickly and provide unique opportunities for research studies owing to their transparency for at least 48 h post fertilization. Zebrafish have many ciliated organs that include primary cilia as well as motile cilia. Using zebrafish as an animal model helps to better understand human diseases such as Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), an autosomal recessive disorder that affects cilia motility, currently associated with more than 50 genes. The aim of this study was to validate zebrafish motile cilia, both in mono and multiciliated cells, as organelles for PCD research. For this purpose, we obtained systematic high-resolution data in both the olfactory pit (OP) and the left–right organizer (LRO), a superficial organ and a deep organ embedded in the tail of the embryo, respectively. For the analysis of their axonemal ciliary structure, we used conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron tomography (ET). We characterised the wild-type OP cilia and showed, for the first time in zebrafish, the presence of motile cilia (9 + 2) in the periphery of the pit and the presence of immotile cilia (still 9 + 2), with absent outer dynein arms, in the centre of the pit. In addition, we reported that a central pair of microtubules in the LRO motile cilia is common in zebrafish, contrary to mouse embryos, but it is not observed in all LRO cilia from the same embryo. We further showed that the outer dynein arms of the microtubular doublet of both the OP and LRO cilia are structurally similar in dimensions to the human respiratory cilia at the resolution of TEM and ET. We conclude that zebrafish is a good model organism for PCD research but investigators need to be aware of the specific physical differences to correctly interpret their results. © 2021 by the authors.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a disorder affecting motile cilia. An early accurate diagnosis helps prevent lung damage and preserve lung function. To make a diagnostic assessment, one of the commonly used methods that allows for the examination of ciliary ultrastructure is transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This allows for a quantitative assessment of ciliary components to identify defects associated with PCD. Heavy metal staining is required to provide a contrast when imaging cilia in the TEM. One of the most commonly used stains is uranyl acetate (UA). UA can be applied to cellular material before embedding (en bloc), or to ultrathin sections of embedded samples (grid staining). UA is radioactive and, due to growing safety concerns and restrictions by government bodies, universities and hospitals, it is essential to find a suitable alternative. We show UA-zero (UAZ), when used en bloc, provides a high contrast and is a suitable replacement for UA. PCD diagnostic experts, having reviewed ciliary cross-sections stained with UAZ en bloc, are confident that the staining and PCD defects are readily detectable similar to samples that have been stained with UA. © 2021 by the authors.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as key players in different stages of atherosclerosis. Here we provide evidence that EVs released by mixed aggregates of monocytes and platelets in response to TNF-α display pro-inflammatory actions on endothelial cells and atherosclerotic plaques. Tempering platelet activation with Iloprost, Aspirin or a P2Y12 inhibitor impacted quantity and phenotype of EV produced. Proteomics of EVs from cells activated with TNF-α alone or in the presence of Iloprost revealed a distinct composition, with interesting hits like annexin-A1 and gelsolin. When added to human atherosclerotic plaque explants, EVs from TNF-α stimulated monocytes augmented release of cytokines. In contrast, EVs generated by TNF-α together with Iloprost produced minimal plaque activation. Notably, patients with coronary artery disease that required percutaneous coronary intervention had elevated plasma numbers of monocyte, platelet as well as double positive EV subsets. In conclusion, EVs released following monocyte/platelet activation may play a potential role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Whereas attenuating platelet activation modifies EV composition released from monocyte/platelet aggregates, curbing their pro-inflammatory actions may offer therapeutic avenues for the treatment of atherosclerosis. © 2021 The Authors.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Many neuronal and retinal disorders are associated with pathological hyperpermeability of the microvasculature. We have used explants of rodent retinae to study acute neurovascular permeability, signal transduction and the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Following stimulation with either vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) or bradykinin (BK), AMPK was rapidly and strongly phosphorylated and acted as a key mediator of permeability downstream of Ca2+. Accordingly, AMPK agonists potently induced acute retinal vascular leakage. AMPK activation led to phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS, also known as NOS3), which in turn increased VE-cadherin (CDH5) phosphorylation on Y685. In parallel, AMPK also mediated phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinases (hereafter p38) and HSP27 (HSPB1), indicating that it regulated paracellular junctions and cellular contractility, both previously associated with endothelial permeability. Endothelial AMPK provided a missing link in neurovascular permeability, connecting Ca2+ transients to the activation of eNOS and p38, irrespective of the permeability-inducing factor used. Collectively, we find that, due to its compatibility with small molecule antagonists and agonists, as well as siRNA, the ex vivo retina model constitutes a reliable tool to identify and study regulators and mechanisms of acute neurovascular permeability. © 2021.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder of the motile cilia. Early accurate diagnosis is important to help prevent lung damage in childhood and to preserve lung function. Confirmation of a diagnosis traditionally relied on assessment of ciliary ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM); however, >50 known PCD genes have made the identification of biallelic mutations a viable alternative to confirm diagnosis. TEM and genotyping lack sensitivity, and research to improve accuracy of both is required. TEM can be challenging when a subtle or partial ciliary defect is present or affected cilia structures are difficult to identify due to poor contrast. Here, we demonstrate software to enhance TEM ciliary images and reduce background by averaging ciliary features. This includes an option to classify features into groups based on their appearance, to generate multiple averages when a nonhomogeneous abnormality is present. We validated this software on images taken from subjects with well-characterized PCD caused by variants in the outer dynein arm (ODA) heavy chain gene DNAH5. Examining more difficult to diagnose cases, we detected 1) regionally restricted absence of the ODAs away from the ciliary base, in a subject carrying mutations in DNAH9; 2) loss of the typically poorly contrasted inner dynein arms; and 3) sporadic absence of part of the central pair complex in subjects carrying mutations in HYDIN, including one case with an unverified genetic diagnosis. We show that this easy-to-use software can assist in detailing relationships between genotype and ultrastructural phenotype, improving diagnosis of PCD. © 2020 the American Physiological Society.

	<b>Abstract</b>: X-linked choroideremia (CHM) is a disease characterized by gradual retinal degeneration caused by loss of the Rab Escort Protein, REP1. Despite partial compensation by REP2 the disease is characterized by prenylation defects in multiple members of the Rab protein family that are master regulators of membrane traffic. Remarkably, the eye is the only organ affected in CHM patients, possibly because of the huge membrane traffic burden of the post mitotic photoreceptors, which synthesise outer segments, and the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium that degrades the spent portions each day. In this study, we aimed to identify defects in membrane traffic that might lead to photoreceptor cell death in CHM. In a heterozygous null female mouse model of CHM (Chmnull/WT), degeneration of the photoreceptor layer was clearly evident from increased numbers of TUNEL positive cells compared to age matched controls, small numbers of cells exhibiting signs of mitochondrial stress and greatly increased microglial infiltration. However, most rod photoreceptors exhibited remarkably normal morphology with well-formed outer segments and no discernible accumulation of transport vesicles in the inner segment. The major evidence of membrane trafficking defects was a shortening of rod outer segments that was evident at 2 months of age but remained constant over the period during which the cells die. A decrease in rhodopsin density found in the outer segment may underlie the outer segment shortening but does not lead to rhodopsin accumulation in the inner segment. Our data argue against defects in rhodopsin transport or outer segment renewal as triggers of cell death in CHM. © 2020 Meschede et al.

	<b>Abstract</b>: The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a highly specialised pigmented monolayer sandwiched between the choroid and the photoreceptors in the retina. Key functions of the RPE include transport of nutrients to the neural retina, removal of waste products and water from the retina to the blood, recycling of retinal chromophores, absorption of scattered light and phagocytosis of the tips of the photoreceptor outer segments. These functions place a considerable membrane trafficking burden on the RPE. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster, we focus on RPE-specific adaptations of trafficking pathways. We outline mechanisms underlying the polarised expression of membrane proteins, melanosome biogenesis and movement, and endocytic trafficking, as well as photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis and degradation. We also briefly discuss theories of how dysfunction in trafficking pathways contributes to retinal disease. © 2020.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a disorder that affects motile cilia in the airway that are required for the removal of mucus, debris, and pathogens. It is important to diagnose PCD in early childhood to preserve lung function. The confirmation of a diagnosis relies on the assessment of ciliary ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM involves the quantitative assessment of the ciliary ultrastructure to identify PCD defects as well as abnormalities resulting from infection. Many specialist diagnostic centres still rely on physical counters to tally results and paper notes to summarise findings before transferring the results to computer databases/records. To speed up the diagnostic data collection and increase the protection of patient information, we have developed digital ciliary feature counters that conform to the PCD reporting international consensus guideline. These counters can be used on a computer or tablet, and automatically generate notes regarding sample observations. We show that the digital counters are easy to use and can generate TEM diagnostic reports that will be useful for many PCD diagnostic centres. © 2020 by the authors.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Mitochondria are known to play an essential role in photoreceptor function and survival that enables normal vision. Within photoreceptors, mitochondria are elongated and extend most of the inner-segment length, where they supply energy for protein synthesis and the phototransduction machinery in the outer segment, as well as acting as a calcium store. Here, we examined the arrangement of the mitochondria within the inner segment in detail using three-dimensional (3D) electron microscopy techniques and show they are tethered to the plasma membrane in a highly specialized arrangement. Remarkably, mitochondria and their cristae openings align with those of neighboring inner segments. The pathway by which photoreceptors meet their high energy demands is not fully understood. We propose this to be a mechanism to share metabolites and assist in maintaining homeostasis across the photoreceptor cell layer. In the extracellular space between photoreceptors, Müller glial processes were identified. Due to the often close proximity to the inner-segment mitochondria, they may, too, play a role in the inner-segment mitochondrial arrangement as well as metabolite shuttling. OPA1 is an important factor in mitochondrial homeostasis, including cristae remodeling; therefore, we examined the photoreceptors of a heterozygous Opa1 knockout mouse model. The cristae structure in the Opa1+/− photoreceptors was not greatly affected, but the mitochondria were enlarged and had reduced alignment to neighboring inner-segment mitochondria. This indicates the importance of key regulators in maintaining this specialized photoreceptor mitochondrial arrangement. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Cilia are cellular organelles that project from the cell. They occur in nearly all non-hematopoietic tissues and have different functions in different tissues. In mesenchymal tissues primary cilia play a crucial role in the adequate morphogenesis during embryological development. In mature articular cartilage, primary cilia fulfil chemo-and mechanosensitive functions to adapt the cellular mechanisms on extracellular changes and thus, maintain tissue homeostasis and morphometry. Ciliary abnormalities in osteoarthritic cartilage could represent pathophysiological relationships between ciliary dysfunction and tissue deformation. Nevertheless, the molecular and pathophysiological relationships of ‘Primary Cilia’ (PC) in the context of osteoarthritis is not yet fully understood. The present review focuses on the current knowledge about PC and provide a short but not exhaustive overview of their role in cartilage. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Transport of dietary cholesterol from endocytic organelles to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is essential for cholesterol homoeostasis, but the mechanism and regulation of this transport remains poorly defined. Membrane contact sites (MCS), microdomains of close membrane apposition, are gaining attention as important platforms for non-vesicular, inter-organellar communication. Here we investigate the impact of ER-endocytic organelle MCS on cholesterol transport. We report a role for Niemann-Pick type C protein 1 (NPC1) in tethering ER-endocytic organelle MCS where it interacts with the ER-localised sterol transport protein Gramd1b to regulate cholesterol egress. We show that artificially tethering MCS rescues the cholesterol accumulation that characterises NPC1-deficient cells, consistent with direct lysosome to ER cholesterol transport across MCS. Finally, we identify an expanded population of lysosome-mitochondria MCS in cells depleted of NPC1 or Gramd1b that is dependent on the late endosomal sterol-binding protein STARD3, likely underlying the mitochondrial cholesterol accumulation in NPC1-deficient cells. © 2019, The Author(s).

	<b>Abstract</b>: Mutations in KCNJ13 are associated with two retinal disorders; Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and snowflake vitreoretinal degeneration (SVD). We examined the retina of kcnj13 mutant zebrafish (obelix td15 , c.502T &amp;gt; C p.[Phe168Leu]) to provide new insights into the pathophysiology underlying these conditions. Detailed phenotyping of obelix td15 fish revealed a late onset retinal degeneration at 12 months. Electron microscopy of the obelix td15 retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) uncovered reduced phagosome clearance and increased mitochondrial number and size prior any signs of retinal degeneration. Melanosome distribution was also affected in dark-adapted 12-month obelix td15 fish. At 6 and 12 months, ATP levels were found to be reduced along with increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and heat shock protein 60. Quantitative RT-PCR of polg2, fis1, opa1, sod1/2 and bcl2a from isolated retina showed expression changes consistent with altered mitochondrial activity and retinal stress. We propose that the retinal disease in this model is primarily a failure of phagosome physiology with a secondary mitochondrial dysfunction. Our findings suggest that alterations in the RPE and photoreceptor cellular organelles may contribute to KCNJ13-related retinal degeneration and provide a therapeutic target. © 2019, The Author(s).

	<b>Abstract</b>: The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a key pharmacological target in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity, undergoes rapid endocytosis after stimulation by endogenous and therapeutic agonists. We have previously highlighted the relevance of this process in finetuning GLP-1R responses in pancreatic beta cells to control insulin secretion. In the present study, we demonstrate an important role for the translocation of active GLP-1Rs into liquidordered plasma membrane nanodomains, which act as hotspots for optimal coordination of intracellular signaling and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This process is dynamically regulated by agonist binding through palmitoylation of the GLP-1R at its carboxyl-terminal tail. Biased GLP-1R agonists and small molecule allosteric modulation both influence GLP-1R palmitoylation, clustering, nanodomain signaling, and internalization. Downstream effects on insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells indicate that these processes are relevant to GLP-1R physiological actions and might be therapeutically targetable. © 2019 Buenaventura et al.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Striated muscle enables movement in all animals by the contraction of myriads of sarcomeres joined end to end by the Z-bands. The contraction is due to tension generated in each sarcomere between overlapping arrays of actin and myosin filaments. At the Z-band actin filaments from adjoining sarcomeres overlap and are cross-linked in a regular pattern mainly by the protein α-actinin. The Z-band is dynamic reflected by the 2 regular patterns seen in transverse section electron micrographs; the so-called small-square and basketweave forms. Although these forms are attributed respectively to relaxed and actively contracting muscles the basketweave form occurs in certain relaxed muscles as in the muscle studied here. We used electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to derive the 3D structure of the Z-band in the swimbladder sonic muscle of type I male plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) into which we docked the crystallographic structures of actin and α-actinin. The α-actinin links run diagonally between connected pairs of antiparallel actin filaments and are oriented at an angle of about 25° away from the actin filament axes. The slightly curved and flattened structure of the α-actinin rod has a distinct fit into the map. The Z-band model provides a detailed understanding of the role of α-actinin in transmitting tension between actin filaments in adjoining sarcomeres. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

	<b>Abstract</b>: PURPOSE. The basal surface of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is folded into a complex basal labyrinth thought to facilitate solute and water transport. We aimed to analyze and define the structural organization of the basal labyrinth of the RPE to enable quantitative analysis of structural changes in age and disease and to better understand the relationship between basal labyrinth structure and efficiency of transepithelial transport. METHODS. Conventional transmission and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy and electron tomography were used to examine the structure of the basal labyrinth in mouse eyes of different ages and genotypes and with and without osmotic shock before fixation. RESULTS. We identified structurally distinct zones (stacked and ribbon-like) within the RPE basal labyrinth that are largely organelle free and cisternal elements that make contact with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. These zones are lost in a hierarchic fashion with age and prematurely in a model of the progressive retinal degenerative disease, choroideremia. Junctional complexes crosslink closely opposed infoldings. Spacing between the basal infoldings was affected by subtle osmotic changes while osmotic shock induced dramatic remodeling of the infoldings. CONCLUSIONS. The basal labyrinth has complex but ordered structural elements that break down with age and in choroideremia. The geometry of these elements and site of contact with ER and mitochondria likely facilitate the ion transport that drives water transport across the basal RPE surface. Changes in structure in response to local osmotic variation may allow transport to be modulated in order to maintain RPE volume. © 2019, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc..

	<b>Abstract</b>: PURPOSE. Mutations in the megalin-encoding gene, LRP2, cause high myopia as seen in patients suffering from Donnai-Barrow/facio-oculo-acoustico-renal syndrome. Megalin is present in both the nonpigmented epithelium of the ciliary body and in the RPE. In this study, we set out to establish an animal model to study the mechanisms underlying the ocular phenotype and to establish if high myopia/megaophthalmos is induced by postnatal megalin-deficiency in the RPE. METHODS. Postnatal RPE-specific deletion of megalin was generated by crossing mice bearing a homozygous loxP-flanked Lrp2 allele with transgenic mice expressing the Cre recombinase driven by the BEST1 promotor. The model was investigated by immunohistologic techniques, and transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS. Mice with postnatal RPE-specific loss of megalin developed a megaophthalmos phenotype with dramatic increase in ocular size and severe retinal thinning associated with compromised vision. This phenotype was present at postnatal day 14, indicating rapid development in the period from onset of BEST1 promotor activity at postnatal day 10. Additionally, RPE melanosomes exhibited abnormal size and morphology, suggested by electron tomography to be caused by fusion events between multiple melanosomes. CONCLUSIONS. Postnatal loss of megalin in the RPE induces dramatic and rapid ocular growth and retinal degeneration compatible with the high myopia observed in Donnai-Barrow patients. The morphologic changes of RPE melanosomes, believed to be largely inert and fully differentiated at birth, suggested a continued plasticity of mature melanosomes and a requirement for megalin to maintain their number and morphology. © 2019 The Authors.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Motile cilia move body fluids and gametes and the beating of cilia lining the airway epithelial surfaces ensures that they are kept clear and protected from inhaled pathogens and consequent respiratory infections. Dynein motor proteins provide mechanical force for cilia beating. Dynein mutations are a common cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), an inherited condition characterized by deficient mucociliary clearance and chronic respiratory disease coupled with laterality disturbances and subfertility. Using next-generation sequencing, we detected mutations in the ciliary outer dynein arm (ODA) heavy chain gene DNAH9 in individuals from PCD clinics with situs inversus and in one case male infertility. DNAH9 and its partner heavy chain DNAH5 localize to type 2 ODAs of the distal cilium and in DNAH9-mutated nasal respiratory epithelial cilia we found a loss of DNAH9/DNAH5-containing type 2 ODAs that was restricted to the distal cilia region. This confers a reduced beating frequency with a subtle beating pattern defect affecting the motility of the distal cilia portion. 3D electron tomography ultrastructural studies confirmed regional loss of ODAs from the distal cilium, manifesting as either loss of whole ODA or partial loss of ODA volume. Paramecium DNAH9 knockdown confirms an evolutionarily conserved function for DNAH9 in cilia motility and ODA stability. We find that DNAH9 is widely expressed in the airways, despite DNAH9 mutations appearing to confer symptoms restricted to the upper respiratory tract. In summary, DNAH9 mutations reduce cilia function but some respiratory mucociliary clearance potential may be retained, widening the PCD disease spectrum. © 2018 American Society of Human Genetics

	<b>Abstract</b>: Macroautophagy (autophagy) is a crucial cellular stress response for degrading defective macromolecules and organelles, as well as providing bioenergetic intermediates during hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. Here we report a thiol-dependent process that may account for impaired autophagy during aging. This is through direct oxidation of key autophagy-related (Atg) proteins Atg3 and Atg7. When inactive Atg3 and Atg7 are protected from oxidation due to stable covalent interaction with their substrate LC3. This interaction becomes transient upon activation of Atg3 and Atg7 due to transfer of LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (lipidation), a process crucial for functional autophagy. However, loss in covalent-bound LC3 also sensitizes the catalytic thiols of Atg3 and Atg7 to inhibitory oxidation that prevents LC3 lipidation, observed in vitro and in mouse aorta. Here findings provide a thiol-dependent process for negatively regulating autophagy that may contribute to the process of aging, as well as therapeutic targets to regulate autophagosome maturation. © 2017 The Author(s).

	<b>Abstract</b>: The immunosuppressive transmembrane protein PD-L1 was shown to traffic via the multivesicular body (MVB) and to be released on exosomes. A high-content siRNA screen identified the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-associated protein ALIX as a regulator of both EGFR activity and PD-L1 surface presentation in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cells. ALIX depletion results in prolonged and enhanced stimulation-induced EGFR activity as well as defective PD-L1 trafficking through the MVB, reduced exosomal secretion, and its redistribution to the cell surface. Increased surface PD-L1 expression confers an EGFR-dependent immunosuppressive phenotype on ALIX-depleted cells. An inverse association between ALIX and PD-L1 expression was observed in human breast cancer tissues, while an immunocompetent mouse model of breast cancer revealed that ALIX-deficient tumors are larger and show an increased immunosuppressive environment. Our data suggest that ALIX modulates immunosuppression through regulation of PD-L1 and EGFR and may, therefore, present a diagnostic and therapeutic target for BLBC. Monypenny et al. show that the ESCRT-related protein ALIX regulates two clinically important proteins in breast cancer; namely, EGFR, a receptor linked to cell survival, and PD-L1, an immune checkpoint protein. ALIX is, therefore, associated with pathways that drive both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of tumor survival. © 2018 The Author(s)

	<b>Abstract</b>: Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles that detect mechanical and chemical stimuli. Although cilia house a number of oncogenic molecules (including Smoothened, KRAS, EGFR, and PDGFR), their precise role in cancer remains unclear. We have interrogated the role of cilia in acquired and de novo resistance to a variety of kinase inhibitors, and found that, in several examples, resistant cells are distinctly characterized by an increase in the number and/or length of cilia with altered structural features. Changes in ciliation seem to be linked to differences in the molecular composition of cilia and result in enhanced Hedgehog pathway activation. Notably, manipulating cilia length via Kif7 knockdown is sufficient to confer drug resistance in drug-sensitive cells. Conversely, targeting of cilia length or integrity through genetic and pharmacological approaches overcomes kinase inhibitor resistance. Our work establishes a role for ciliogenesis and cilia length in promoting cancer drug resistance and has significant translational implications. Jenks et al. demonstrate that enhanced ciliogenesis can facilitate resistance to a number of kinase inhibitors. Both acquired and de novo resistant cells show increases in cilia numbers and length and increased Hedgehog signaling. Targeting ciliogenesis or ciliary signaling overcomes kinase inhibitor resistance. © 2018 The Authors

	<b>Abstract</b>: In primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), motile ciliary dysfunction arises from ciliary defects usually confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In 30% of patients, such as those with DNAH11 mutations, apparently normal ultrastructure makes diagnosis difficult. Genetic analysis supports diagnosis, but may not identify definitive causal variants. Electron tomography, an extension of TEM, produces three-dimensional ultrastructural ciliary models with superior resolution to TEM. Our hypothesis is that tomography using existing patient samples will enable visualisation of DNAH11-associated ultrastructural defects. Dual axis tomograms from araldite-embedded nasal cilia were collected in 13 PCD patients with normal ultrastructure (DNAH11 n=7, HYDIN n=2, CCDC65 n=3 and DRC1 n=1) and six healthy controls, then analysed using IMOD and Chimera software. DNAH11 protein is localised to the proximal ciliary region. Within this region, electron tomography indicated a deficiency of >25% of proximal outer dynein arm volume in all patients with DNAH11 mutations (n=7) compared to other patients with PCD and normal ultrastructure (n=6) and healthy controls (n=6). DNAH11 mutations cause a shared abnormality in ciliary ultrastructure previously undetectable by TEM. Advantageously, electron tomography can be used on existing diagnostic samples and establishes a structural abnormality where ultrastructural studies were previously normal. Copyright ©ERS 2018

	<b>Abstract</b>: Correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM) is a powerful technique allowing localisation of specific macromolecules within fluorescence microscopy (FM) images to be mapped onto corresponding high-resolution electron microscopy (EM) images. Existing methods are applicable to limited sample types and are technically challenging. Here we describe novel methods to perform CLEM and immuno-electron microscopy (iEM) on cryostat sections uti-lising the popular FM embedding solution, optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound. Utilising these approaches, we have (i) identified the same phagosomes by FM and EM in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of retinal tissue (ii) shown the correct localisation of rhodopsin on photoreceptor outer segment disc like-structures in iPSC derived optic cups and (iii) identified a novel interaction between peroxisomes and melanosomes as well as phagosomes in the RPE. These data show that cryostat sections allow easy characterisation of target macromolecule localisation within tissue samples, thus providing a substantial improvement over many conventional methods that are limited to cultured cells. As OCT embedding is routinely used for FM this provides an easily accessible and robust method for further analysis of existing samples by high resolution EM. © 2018 Burgoyne et al.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss. The protein HtrA1 is enriched in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells isolated from AMD patients and in drusen deposits. However, it is poorly understood how increased levels of HtrA1 affect the physiological function of the RPE at the intracellular level. Here, we developed hfRPE (human fetal retinal pigment epithelial) cell culture model where cells fully differentiated into a polarized functional monolayer. In this model, we fine-tuned the cellular levels of HtrA1 by targeted overexpression. Our data show that HtrA1 enzymatic activity leads to intracellular degradation of tubulin with a corresponding reduction in the number of microtubules, and consequently to an altered mechanical cell phenotype. HtrA1 overexpression further leads to impaired apical processes and decreased phagocytosis, an essential function for photoreceptor survival. These cellular alterations correlate with the AMD phenotype and thus highlight HtrA1 as an intracellular target for therapeutic interventions towards AMD treatment. © 2017 The Authors

	<b>Abstract</b>: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common form of inherited retinal dystrophy. We recently identified mutations in REEP6, which encodes the receptor expression enhancing protein 6, in several families with autosomal recessive RP. REEP6 is related to the REEP and Yop1p family of ER shaping proteins and potential receptor accessory proteins, but the role of REEP6 in the retina is unknown. Here we characterize the disease mechanisms associated with loss of REEP6 function using a Reep6 knockout mouse generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. In control mice REEP6 was localized to the inner segment and outer plexiform layer of rod photoreceptors. The Reep6-/- mice exhibited progressive photoreceptor degeneration from P20 onwards. Ultrastructural analyses at P20 by transmission electron microscopy and 3View serial block face scanning EM revealed an expansion of the distal ER in the Reep6-/- rods and an increase in their number of mitochondria. Electroretinograms revealed photoreceptor dysfunction preceded degeneration, suggesting potential defects in phototransduction. There was no effect on the traffic of rhodopsin, Rom1 or peripherin/rds; however, the retinal guanylate cyclases GC1 and GC2 were severely affected in the Reep6 knockout animals, with almost undetectable expression. These changes correlated with an increase in C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression and the activation of caspase 12, suggesting that ER stress contributes to cell death. Collectively, these data suggest that REEP6 plays an essential role in maintaining cGMP homeostasis though facilitating the stability and/or trafficking of guanylate cyclases and maintaining ER and mitochondrial homeostasis. © 2017 The Author 2017.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Lymphocyte transendothelial migration (TEM) is critically dependent on intraendothelial signaling triggered by adhesion to ICAM-1. Here we show that endothelial MAPKs ERK, p38, and JNK mediate diapedesis-related and diapedesis-unrelated functions of ICAM- 1 in cerebral and dermal microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs). All three MAPKs were activated by ICAM-1 engagement, either through lymphocyte adhesion or Ab-mediated clustering. MAPKs were involved in ICAM-1-dependent expression of TNF-α in cerebral and dermal MVECs, and CXCL8, CCL3, CCL4, VCAM-1, and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in cerebral MVECs. Endothelial JNK and to a much lesser degree p38 were the principal MAPKs involved in facilitating diapedesis of CD4+ lymphocytes across both types of MVECs, whereas ERK was additionally required for TEM across dermal MVECs. JNK activity was critical for ICAM-1-induced F-actin rearrangements. Furthermore, activation of endothelial ICAM-1/JNK led to phosphorylation of paxillin, its association with VE-cadherin, and internalization of the latter. Importantly ICAM-1-induced phosphorylation of paxillin was required for lymphocyte TEM and converged functionally with VE-cadherin phosphorylation. Taken together we conclude that during lymphocyte TEM, ICAM-1 signaling diverges into pathways regulating lymphocyte diapedesis, and other pathways modulating gene expression thereby contributing to the long-term inflammatory response of the endothelium. © 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Heterogeneity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in genetically identical cells, which occurs in response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, remains poorly understood. MAPK cascades integrate signals emanating from different EGFR spatial locations, including the plasma membrane and endocytic compartment. We previously hypothesized that in EGF-stimulated cells the MAPK phosphorylation (pMAPK) level and activity are largely determined by the spatial organization of the EGFR clusters within the cell. For experimental testing of this hypothesis, we used super-resolution microscopy to define EGFR clusters by receptor numbers (N) and average intracluster distances (d). From these data, we predicted the extent of pMAPK with 85% accuracy on a cell-to-cell basis with control data returning 54% accuracy (P < 0.001). For comparison, the prediction accuracy was only 61% (P = 0.382) when the diffraction-limited averaged fluorescence intensity/cluster was used. Large clusters (N ≥ 3) with d > 50 nm were most predictive for pMAPK level in cells. Electron microscopy revealed that these large clusters were primarily localized to the limiting membrane of multivesicular bodies (MVB). Many tighter packed dimers/multimers (d < 50 nm) were found on intraluminal vesicles within MVBs, where they were unlikely to activate MAPK because of the physical separation. Our results suggest that cell-to-cell differences in N and d contain crucial information to predict EGFR-activated cellular pMAPK levels and explain pMAPK heterogeneity in isogenic cells. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most frequent form of inherited retinal dystrophy. RP is genetically heterogeneous and the genes identified to date encode proteins involved in a wide range of functional pathways, including photoreceptor development, phototransduction, the retinoid cycle, cilia, and outer segment development. Here we report the identification of biallelic mutations in Receptor Expression Enhancer Protein 6 (REEP6) in seven individuals with autosomal-recessive RP from five unrelated families. REEP6 is a member of the REEP/Yop1 family of proteins that influence the structure of the endoplasmic reticulum but is relatively unstudied. The six variants identified include three frameshift variants, two missense variants, and a genomic rearrangement that disrupts exon 1. Human 3D organoid optic cups were used to investigate REEP6 expression and confirmed the expression of a retina-specific isoform REEP6.1, which is specifically affected by one of the frameshift mutations. Expression of the two missense variants (c.383C>T [p.Pro128Leu] and c.404T>C [p.Leu135Pro]) and the REEP6.1 frameshift mutant in cultured cells suggest that these changes destabilize the protein. Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing was used to produce Reep6 knock-in mice with the p.Leu135Pro RP-associated variant identified in one RP-affected individual. The homozygous knock-in mice mimic the clinical phenotypes of RP, including progressive photoreceptor degeneration and dysfunction of the rod photoreceptors. Therefore, our study implicates REEP6 in retinal homeostasis and highlights a pathway previously uncharacterized in retinal dystrophy. © 2016 The Authors

	<b>Abstract</b>: Multivesicular endosomes/bodies (MVBs) are endosomes that contain small intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) within their lumen. Many studies have analyzed the effects of inhibiting endocytosis on signal transduction and revealed that, although many signaling pathways can be activated from the plasma membrane, some require endocytosis for maximal activation. This chapter focuses on the role of MVBs. It reviews the ways in which sorting onto ILVs of MVBs can downregulate intracellular signaling, taking the canonical receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), as an example. The chapter examines the evidence for a role of sequestration of inhibitory factors on ILVs in the upregulation of signaling, focusing on the role of sequestration of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3) in upregulating Wnt signaling. Finally, it also reviews how sorting onto ILVs and the subsequent release of those ILVs as exosomes can promote intercellular signaling, taking long-range signaling of Notch ligands as an example. © 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

	<b>Abstract</b>: The outer segments of vertebrate rod photoreceptors are renewed every 10 d. Outer segment components are transported from the site of synthesis in the inner segment through the connecting cilium, followed by assembly of the highly ordered discs. Two models of assembly of discrete discs involving either successive fusion events between intracellular rhodopsin-bearing vesicles or the evagination of the plasma membrane followed by fusion of adjacent evaginations have been proposed. Here we use immuno-electron microscopy and electron tomography to show that rhodopsin is transported from the inner to the outer segment via the ciliary plasma membrane, subsequently forming successive evaginations that "zipper" up proximally, but at their leading edges are free to make junctions containing the protocadherin, PCDH21, with the inner segment plasma membrane. Given the physical dimensions of the evaginations, coupled with likely instability of the membrane cortex at the distal end of the connecting cilium, we propose that the evagination occurs via a process akin to blebbing and is not driven by actin polymerization. Disassembly of these junctions is accompanied by fusion of the leading edges of successive evaginations to form discrete discs. This fusion is topologically different to that mediated by the membrane fusion proteins, SNAREs, as initial fusion is between exoplasmic leaflets, and is accompanied by gain of the tetraspanin rim protein, peripherin.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell death is a hallmark of age-related macular degeneration. The alternative pathway of complement activation is strongly implicated in RPE cell dysfunction and loss in age-related macular degeneration; therefore, it is critical that RPE cells use molecular strategies to mitigate the potentially harmful effects of complement attack. We show that the terminal complement complex C5b-9 assembles rapidly on the basal surface of cultured primary porcine RPE cells but disappears over 48 h without any discernable adverse effects on the cells. However, in the presence of the dynamin inhibitor dynasore, C5b-9 was almost completely retained at the cell surface, suggesting that, under normal circumstances, it is eliminated via the endocytic pathway. In support of this idea, we observed that C5b-9 colocalizes with the early endosome marker EEA1 and that, in the presence of protease inhibitors, it can be detected in lysosomes. Preventing the endocytosis of C5b-9 by RPE cells led to structural defects in mitochondrial morphology consistent with cell stress. We conclude that RPE cells use the endocytic pathway to prevent the accumulation of C5b-9 on the cell surface and that processing and destruction of C5b-9 by this route are essential for RPE cell survival.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Stress exposure triggers ligand-independent EGF receptor (EGFR) endocytosis, but its post-endocytic fate and role in regulating signalling are unclear. We show that the p38 MAP kinase-dependent, EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK)-independent EGFR internalization induced by ultraviolet light C (UVC) or the cancer therapeutic cisplatin, is followed by diversion from the canonical endocytic pathway. Instead of lysosomal degradation or plasma membrane recycling, EGFR accumulates in a subset of LBPA-rich perinuclear multivesicular bodies (MVBs) distinct from those carrying EGF-stimulated EGFR. Stress-internalized EGFR co-segregates with exogenously expressed pre-melanosomal markers OA1 and fibrillar PMEL, following early endosomal sorting by the actin polymerization-promoting WASH complex. Stress-internalized EGFR is retained intracellularly by continued p38 activity in a mechanism involving ubiquitin-independent, ESCRT/ALIX-dependent incorporation onto intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of MVBs. In contrast to the internalization-independent EGF-stimulated activation, UVC/cisplatin-triggered EGFR activation depends on EGFR internalization and intracellular retention. EGFR signalling from this MVB subpopulation delays apoptosis and might contribute to chemoresistance. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

	<b>Abstract</b>: The Z-band in vertebrate striated muscle crosslinks actin filaments of opposite polarity from adjoining sarcomeres and transmits tension along myofibrils during muscular contraction. It is also the location of a number of proteins involved in signalling and myofibrillogenesis; mutations in these proteins lead to myopathies. Understanding the high-resolution structure of the Z-band will help us understand its role in muscle contraction and the role of these proteins in the function of muscle. The appearance of the Z-band in transverse-section electron micrographs typically resembles a small-square lattice or a basketweave appearance. In longitudinal sections, the Z-band width varies more with muscle type than species: slow skeletal and cardiac muscles have wider Z-bands than fast skeletal muscles. As the Z-band is periodic, Fourier methods have previously been used for three-dimensional structural analysis. To cope with variations in the periodic structure of the Z-band, we have used subtomogram averaging of tomograms of rat cardiac muscle in which subtomograms are extracted and compared and similar ones are averaged. We show that the Z-band comprises four to six layers of links, presumably α-actinin, linking antiparallel overlapping ends of the actin filaments from the adjoining sarcomeres. The reconstruction shows that the terminal 5-7 nm of the actin filaments within the Z-band is devoid of any α-actinin links and is likely to be the location of capping protein CapZ. © 2015 The Authors.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Analysis of melanosome biogenesis in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is challenging because it occurs predominantly in a short embryonic time window. Here, we show that the zebrafish provides an ideal model system for studying this process because in the RPE the timing of melanosome biogenesis facilitates molecular manipulation using morpholinos. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of OA1 (also known as GPR143), mutations in the human homologue of which cause the most common form of human ocular albinism, induces a major reduction in melanosome number, recapitulating a key feature of the mammalian disease where reduced melanosome numbers precede macromelanosome formation. We further show that PMEL, a key component of mammalian melanosome biogenesis, is required for the generation of cylindrical melanosomes in zebrafish, which in turn is required for melanosome movement into the apical processes and maintenance of photoreceptor integrity. Spherical and cylindrical melanosomes containing similar melanin volumes co-exist in the cell body but only cylindrical melanosomes enter the apical processes. Taken together, our findings indicate that melanosome number and shape are independently regulated and that melanosome shape controls a function in the RPE that depends on localisation in the apical processes. © 2015.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Communication between organelles is a necessary consequence of intracellular compartmentalization. Membrane contact sites (MCSs) are regions where the membranes of two organelles come into close apposition allowing exchange of small molecules and ions including Ca2+. The ER, the cell's major Ca2+ store, forms an extensive and dynamic network of contacts with multiple organelles. Here we review established and emerging roles of ER contacts as platforms for Ca2+ exchange and further consider a potential role for Ca2+ in the regulation of MCS formation. We additionally discuss the challenges associated with the study of MCS biology and highlight advances in microscopy-based solutions.

	<b>Abstract</b>: The vascular endothelium operates in a highly polarized environment, but to date there has been littleexploration of apicobasal polarization of its signaling. We show that VEGF-A, histamine, IGFBP3, and LPA trigger unequal endothelial responses when acting from the circulation or the parenchymal side at blood-neural barriers. For VEGF-A, highly polarized receptor distribution contributed to distinct signaling patterns: VEGFR2, which was found to be predominantly abluminal, mediated increased permeability via p38; in contrast, luminal VEGFR1 led to Akt activation and facilitated cytoprotection. Importantly, such differential apicobasal signaling and VEGFR distribution were found in the microvasculature of brain and retina but not lung, indicating that endothelial cells at blood-neural barriers possess specialized signaling compartments that assign different functions depending on whether an agonist is tissue or blood borne. © 2014 The Authors.

	<b>Abstract</b>: A diverse family of cytoskeletal dynein motors powers various cellular transport systems, including axonemal dyneins generating the force for ciliary and flagellar beating essential to movement of extracellular fluids and of cells through fluid. Multisubunit outer dynein arm (ODA) motor complexes, produced and preassembled in the cytosol, are transported to the ciliary or flagellar compartment and anchored into the axonemal microtubular scaffold via the ODA docking complex (ODA-DC) system. In humans, defects in ODA assembly are the major cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), an inherited disorder of ciliary and flagellar dysmotility characterized by chronic upper and lower respiratory infections and defects in laterality. Here, by combined high-throughput mapping and sequencing, we identified CCDC151 loss-of-function mutations in five affected individuals from three independent families whose cilia showed a complete loss of ODAs and severely impaired ciliary beating. Consistent with the laterality defects observed in these individuals, we found Ccdc151 expressed in vertebrate left-right organizers. Homozygous zebrafish ccdc151ts272a and mouse Ccdc151Snbl mutants display a spectrum of situs defects associated with complex heart defects.We demonstrate that CCDC151 encodes an axonemal coiled coil protein, mutations in which abolish assembly of CCDC151 into respiratory cilia and cause a failure in axonemal assembly of the ODA component DNAH5 and the ODA-DC-Associated components CCDC114 and ARMC4. CCDC151-deficient zebrafish, planaria, and mice also display ciliary dysmotility accompanied by ODA loss. Furthermore, CCDC151 coimmunoprecipitates CCDC114 and thus appears to be a highly evolutionarily conserved ODA-DC-related protein involved in mediating assembly of both ODAs and their axonemal docking machinery onto ciliary microtubules.. © 2014 by The American Society of Human Genetics.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited chronic respiratory obstructive disease with randomized body laterality and infertility, resulting from cilia and sperm dysmotility. PCD is characterized by clinical variability and extensive genetic heterogeneity, associated with different cilia ultrastructural defects and mutations identified in >20 genes. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies therefore present a promising approach for genetic diagnosis which is not yet in routine use.We developed a targeted panel-based NGS pipeline to identify mutations by sequencing of selected candidate genes in 70 genetically undefined PCD patients. This detected loss-of-function RSPH1 mutations in four individuals with isolated central pair (CP) agenesis and normal body laterality, from two unrelated families. Ultrastructural analysis in RSPH1-mutated cilia revealed transposition of peripheraloutermicrotubules intothe 'empty'CPspace, accompaniedbyadistinctive intermittent lossof the central pair microtubules. We find that mutations in RSPH1, RSPH4A and RSPH9, which all encode homologs of components of the 'head' structure of ciliary radial spoke complexes identified in Chlamydomonas, cause clinical phenotypes that appear to be indistinguishable except at the gene level. By high-resolution immunofluorescence we identified a loss of RSPH4A and RSPH9 along with RSPH1 from RSPH1-mutated cilia, suggesting RSPH1 mutations may result in loss of the entire spoke head structure. CP loss is seen in up to 28% of PCD cases, in whom laterality determination specified by CP-less embryonic node cilia remains undisturbed.We propose this defect could arise from instability or agenesis of the ciliary central microtubules due to loss of their normal radial spoke head tethering. © The Author 2014.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Primary ciliary dyskinesia is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting the motility of cilia. There are a range of ultrastructural ciliary defects that lead to associated clinical symptoms including ineffective mucus clearance, reduced lung function, infertility, and left-right isomerism. Mutations in radial spoke head proteins are a known cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia. Ultrastructually these defects are identified by a portion of cilia lacking a central pair and transposed outer microtubular doublets. We have repeatedly observed an intermittent loss of the central pair in patients with a transposition defect. To further understand the central pair changes in these radial spoke head mutations we employ electron tomography, a high resolution electron microscope technique, to elucidate in three dimensions the ultrastructural arrangements caused by mutation of the RSPH4A gene. We thereby provide an explanation of the structures observed by conventional electron microscopy studies. We demonstrate that the central pair can be present within the cilium. In some cilia, the central pair rotates at the base of the axoneme. We propose that it is this rotation that gives rise to an intermittent appearance of the central pair when viewed under conventional electron microscopy. We discuss the potential causes and consequences of these findings. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Multivesicular endosomes/bodies (MVBs) deliver proteins, such as activated EGF receptor (EGFR), to the lysosome for degradation, and, in pigmented cells, MVBs containing PMEL are an initial stage in melanosome biogenesis. The mechanisms regulating numbers and fate of different populations of MVB are unclear. Here, we focus on the role of the G-protein-coupled receptor OA1 (also known as GPR143), which is expressed exclusively in pigmented cells and mutations in which cause the most common type of ocular albinism. When exogenously expressing PMEL, HeLa cells have been shown to form MVBs resembling early stage melanosomes. To focus on the role of OA1 in the initial stages of melanosome biogenesis we take advantage of the absence of the later stages of melanosome maturation in HeLa cells to determine whether OA1 activity can regulate MVB number and fate. Expression of wild-type but not OA1 mutants carrying inactivating mutations or deletions causes MVB numbers to increase. Whereas OA1 expression has no effect on delivery of EGFR-containing MVBs to the lysosome, it inhibits the lysosomal delivery of PMEL and PMEL-containing MVBs accumulate. We propose that OA1 activity delays delivery of PMEL-containing MVBs to the lysosome to allow time for melanin synthesis and commitment to melanosome biogenesis. © 2013.Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Methamphetamine's (METH) neurotoxicity is thought to be in part due to its ability to induce blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. Here, we investigated the effect of METH on barrier properties of cultured rat primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs). Transendothelial flux doubled in response to METH, irrespective of the size of tracer used. At the same time, transendothelial electrical resistance was unchanged as was the ultrastructural appearance of inter-endothelial junctions and the distribution of key junction proteins, suggesting that METH promoted vesicular but not junctional transport. Indeed, METH significantly increased uptake of horseradish peroxidase into vesicular structures. METH also enhanced transendothelial migration of lymphocytes indicating that the endothelial barrier against both molecules and cells was compromised. Barrier breakdown was only observed in response to METH at low micromolar concentrations, with enhanced vesicular uptake peaking at 1 μM METH. The BMVEC response to METH also involved rapid activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and its inhibition abrogated METH-induced permeability and lymphocyte migration, indicating that nitric oxide was a key mediator of BBB disruption in response to METH. This study underlines the key role of nitric oxide in BBB function and describes a novel mechanism of drug-induced fluid-phase transcytosis at the BBB. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

	<b>Abstract</b>: The ultrastructures of cilia and flagella are highly similar and well conserved through evolution. Consequently, Chlamydomonas is commonly used as a model organism for the study of human respiratory cilia. Since detailed models of Chlamydomonas axonemes were generated using cryoelectron tomography, disparities among some of the ultrastructural features have become apparent when compared with human cilia. Extrapolating information on human disease from the Chlamydomonas model may lead to discrepancies in translational research. This study aimed to establish the first three-dimensional ultrastructural model of human cilia. Tomograms of transverse sections (n = 6) and longitudinal sections (n = 9) of human nasal respiratory cilia were generated from three healthy volunteers. Key features of the cilium were resolved using subatomic averaging, and were measured. For validation of the method, a model of the well characterized structure of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was simultaneously generated. Data were combined to create a fully quantified three-dimensional reconstruction of human nasal respiratory cilia. We highlight key differences in the axonemal sheath, microtubular doublets, radial spokes, and dynein arms between the two structures. We show a decreased axial periodicity of the radial spokes, inner dynein arms, and central pair protrusions in the human model. We propose that this first human model will provide a basis for research into the function and structure of human respiratory cilia in health and in disease.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by defective cilia and flagella motility. Chronic destructive-airway disease is caused by abnormal respiratory-tract mucociliary clearance. Abnormal propulsion of sperm flagella contributes to male infertility. Genetic defects in most individuals affected by PCD cause randomization of left-right body asymmetry; approximately half show situs inversus or situs ambiguous. Almost 70 years after the hy3 mouse possessing Hydin mutations was described as a recessive hydrocephalus model, we report HYDIN mutations in PCD-affected persons without hydrocephalus. By homozygosity mapping, we identified a PCD-associated locus, chromosomal region 16q21-q23, which contains HYDIN. However, a nearly identical 360 kb paralogous segment (HYDIN2) in chromosomal region 1q21.1 complicated mutational analysis. In three affected German siblings linked to HYDIN, we identified homozygous c.3985G&amp;gt;T mutations that affect an evolutionary conserved splice acceptor site and that subsequently cause aberrantly spliced transcripts predicting premature protein termination in respiratory cells. Parallel whole-exome sequencing identified a homozygous nonsense HYDIN mutation, c.922A&amp;gt;T (p.Lys307*), in six individuals from three Faroe Island PCD-affected families that all carried an 8.8 Mb shared haplotype across HYDIN, indicating an ancestral founder mutation in this isolated population. We demonstrate by electron microscopy tomography that, consistent with the effects of loss-of-function mutations, HYDIN mutant respiratory cilia lack the C2b projection of the central pair (CP) apparatus; similar findings were reported in Hydin-deficient Chlamydomonas and mice. High-speed videomicroscopy demonstrated markedly reduced beating amplitudes of respiratory cilia and stiff sperm flagella. Like the hy3 mouse model, all nine PCD-affected persons had normal body composition because nodal cilia function is apparently not dependent on the function of the CP apparatus. © 2012 The American Society of Human Genetics.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Activated EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) undergoes ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport)-mediated sorting on to ILVs (intraluminal vesicles) of endosomes before degradation in the lysosome. Sorting of endocytosed EGFR on to ILVs removes the catalytic domain of the EGFR from the cytoplasm, resulting in termination of receptor signalling. EGFR signalling is also subject to down-regulation through receptor dephosphorylation by the ER (endoplasmic reticulum)-localized PTP1B (protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B). PTP1B on the cytoplasmic face of the ER interacts with endocytosed EGFR via direct membrane contacts sites between the ER and endosomes. In the present paper, we review the relationship between ER - endosome membrane contact sites and ILV formation, and their potential role in the regulation of EGFR sorting on to ILVs, through PTP1B-mediated dephosphorylation of both EGFR and components of the ESCRT machinery. ©The Authors Journal compilation ©2012 Biochemical Society.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Aims: An intriguing difference between vertebrate skeletal and cardiac muscles is that the lengths of the thin filaments are constant in the former but variable in the latter. The thick filaments have constant lengths in both types of muscles. The contractile behaviour of a muscle is affected by the lengths of both types of filaments as the tension generated during contraction depends on the amount of filament overlap. To understand the behaviour of cardiac muscle, it is important to know the distribution of the thin filament lengths. The previous detailed analysis by Robinson and Winegrad used serial transverse sections to determine the lengths of the thin filaments. However, the precision, set by the 100 nm section thickness, was low. Here, we have used electron tomography to produce 3D images of rat and mouse cardiac muscles in which we can actually see individual thin filaments up to the free ends and see that these free ends have variable locations. For comparison, we also measure the thin filament lengths in skeletal muscle (frog sartorius). Methods and results: Cardiac papillary muscles were obtained from a rat (Sprague-Dawley) and a mouse (C57/B6). Skeletal muscle (sartorius) was obtained from a frog (Rana pipiens). Longitudinal sections (100 nm thick) were used to produce tilt series and tomograms from which the thin filament paths were traced. Cardiac papillary muscle thin filaments in rat and mouse range from 0.94 to 1.10 μm, with a mean length of 1.04 μm and standard deviation of 0.03 μm. For frog sartorius muscle, the thin filament length was 0.94 μm with standard deviation of 0.01 μm. Conclusion: Electron tomography of cardiac and skeletal muscles allows direct visualization and high precision measurement of the lengths of thin filaments. © The Author 2008.
